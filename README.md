## Abstract
This project presents a novel multi-task learning approach to enhance the performance of load forecasting models using a combination of an autoencoder and LSTM. The framework forecasts future load values while reconstructing historical load patterns. By transferring the encoderâ€™s hidden and cell states to the forecasting decoder, the model achieves significant improvements in accuracy compared to traditional models.

# Introduction
Accurate electrical load forecasting is critical for utility companies to reduce operational costs and manage power grids effectively. This project leverages advances in deep learning to develop a robust multi-task learning model. The approach forecasts electricity loads while reconstructing historical data, offering better predictive accuracy and temporal pattern understanding.

# Dataset 
The dataset used in this project is the **PJM hourly load dataset**, a publicly available resource. PJM is a regional transmission organization (RTO) that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity across multiple states in the United States and the District of Columbia.

## Key Features
### Time-Based Features
- **Hour of the day**: Captures intraday variations in load demand.
- **Day of the week**: Differentiates weekdays from weekends to account for weekly patterns.
- **Month**: Accounts for seasonal variations in electricity demand.

### Temperature Predictors
- **Maximum temperature**: Highest temperature recorded within the network for a specific hour.
- **Minimum temperature**: Lowest temperature recorded within the network for a specific hour.
- **Lagged temperature variables**: Includes temperature values from the previous hour to capture trends.

### Engineered Features
- **Next maximum temperature**: Projected maximum temperature for the next hour.
- **Lagged load variables**: Previous load values to capture temporal dependencies.
- **Day type**: Encodes whether the day is a weekday or weekend.

# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step in ensuring the dataset is clean, consistent, and structured for effective model training and evaluation. This process involves feature extraction, handling missing data, and transforming the dataset into a supervised learning format.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. **Parsing and Feature Extraction**:
   - Convert time columns into a datetime format.
   - Extract features such as hour, day, and month.
   
2. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Remove rows with missing data to maintain dataset consistency.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create lagged variables and next-step predictors to improve model performance.
   
4. **Normalization**:
   - Apply MinMax scaling to normalize all feature values to a range of [0, 1].

5. **Supervised Learning Format**:
   - Transform the time-series data into a supervised learning format using lagged data for historical inputs and the next 24-hour horizon for targets.

## Notes
- The dataset includes hourly load data, making it ideal for short-term forecasting.
- Temperature predictors and time-based features significantly enhance the model's ability to capture seasonal and diurnal patterns.
